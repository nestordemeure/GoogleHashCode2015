# Google Hash Code 2015 (qualification round)

I tried the problem in conditions (4h to produce the best score possible) but was unable to solve a bug in time (my method to compute the intermediate score would always output 0) so I butchered a greedy solution during the last 30minutes.

The greedy solution gave a result worth 136points (I would have needed 360points to be qualified).
