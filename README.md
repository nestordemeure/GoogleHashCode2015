# Google Hash Code 2015 (qualification round)

## Summary

I tried the problem in conditions (4h to produce the best score possible) but was unable to solve a bug in time (my method to compute the intermediate score would always output 0) so I butchered a greedy solution during the last 30minutes.

The greedy solution gave a result worth **136points** (I would have needed 360points to be qualified).

## Notes

The greedy solution takes time to implement and will not bring many points but it helps debugging everything but the solver and making sure one has some points.

Tracking the bug alone and under stress proved impossible, it might be easier in group were some peoples can test part of the code while other redact the parts that are still missing.
